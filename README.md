# ToeWitch
Toe Witch (working title) is a tower-defense-like game where the Toe Witch must breed magical plants to defend her yard from those who would trample it. Think Plants vs. Zombies with some of the mechanics of a food service sim, plus a lot of terrible foot puns.

The folder Toe_Witch contains the full Unity project. Scripts can be found in Toe_Witch > Assets > Scripts.

I created this project almost completely from scratch, with the only downloaded assets being sound effects. The goal of the project was to gain new skills and create something to showcase my abilities.
