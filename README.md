# ToeWitch
Toe Witch (working title) is a tower-defense-like game where the Toe Witch must breed magical plants to defend her yard from those who would trample it. Think Plants vs. Zombies with some of the mechanics of a food service sim, plus a lot of terrible foot puns.

The folder Toe_Witch contains the full Unity project. Scripts can be found in Toe_Witch > Assets > Scripts.

A playable version of the game can be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cdo8p7g3gn8jc2d/AABrubx3dFQ4zcDtnLZoy4xZa?dl=0
