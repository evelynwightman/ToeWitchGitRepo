# ToeWitch
Toe Witch (working title) is a tower-defense-like game where the Toe Witch must breed magical plants to defend her yard from those who would trample it.

The folder ToeWitch contains the full Unity project.

To run the most recent version of the game, download all loose files (there should be one application entitled "Toe Witch Build" and two PDB files beginning with player_win) and the folder "Toe Witch Build Data". Store them all in the same place and run the application.
