# ToeWitch
Toe Witch (working title) is a tower-defense-like game where the Toe Witch must breed magical plants to defend her yard from those who would trample it.

The folder Toe_Witch contains the full Unity project. Scripts can be found in Toe_Witch > Assets > Scripts.

To run the most recently built version of the game, download Toe Witch Build.exe, player_win_x86_s.pdb, and the folder "Toe Witch Build Data". Store them all in the same place and run the application. There is currently no quit menu, so you'll have to force quit the game when you're done.
